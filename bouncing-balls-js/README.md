Make the outline thickness of the container sphere thinner, 
when tracing the movement of the balls inside the container sphere, trace them in a form that is equal to the size of the balls and gets smaller and smaller as they move away from the balls.

The colour of the ball has changed to white 
Change it back to the original colour of the ball, with a transparency of .6 at the start of the trail, the same colour as the ball, and 0 as it moves away from the ball. The shape of the ball should not be obscured by the trail. Modify the length of the trail to be 1.2 times as long as it is now, based on the ball's speed.
